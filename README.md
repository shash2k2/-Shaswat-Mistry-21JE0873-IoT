The objective of the IoT project was, creating a system that controls switches, primarily for lights and fans and other such appliances which get left on even when not in use, to switch them off, based on the number of people in the room.

The system consists of a solution to finding out the number of people in the room, assuming there is only one entrance, and sets off a timer when the number of people in the room reaches zero, to switch off all on appliances.

It also contains mobile control via bluetooth, to force control upon the switches and have mobile control over the switches.

Arduino UNO, Relay modules, Bluetooth module, Force Dependent Resistors and some other basic components were used.

(P.S. The code is still on halt since I require the force dependent resistors, bluetooth module to test out functionality)
(Need a collection of data on the analog readings of the FDRs to determine the allowed variation to not add to count)
